## Security Testing Best Practices

### 1. Test Organization
- Each test file focuses on a specific security domain
- Tests are organized by attack vector and defensive measure
- Clear naming conventions for easy identification

### 2. Realistic Attack Scenarios
- Tests simulate real-world attack patterns
- Include both automated and manual attack vectors
- Cover OWASP Top 10 and common vulnerability categories

### 3. Defensive Validation
- Tests validate that security controls are properly implemented
- Verify that attacks are detected and blocked
- Ensure proper logging and alerting of security events

### 4. Continuous Integration
- Security tests run automatically on every code change
- Tests fail fast on security regressions
- Security test results are tracked over time

## Security Test Maintenance

### Adding New Security Tests
1. Identify new security requirements or threats
2. Create test scenarios that validate defensive measures
3. Follow existing test patterns and organization
4. Update this README with new test information
5. Ensure tests run in CI/CD pipeline

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Review tests regularly for new attack patterns
2. Update tests when security controls change
3. Maintain comprehensive coverage as code evolves
4. Keep tests aligned with current security standards

### Security Test Review Process
1. Security tests should be reviewed by security team
2. All security test changes require approval
3. Regular security test audits should be conducted
4. Test effectiveness should be validated periodically

## Integration with Security Processes

### Development Workflow
- Security tests run on every pull request
- Developers must fix failing security tests before merge
- Security test coverage is tracked and reported

### Security Review Process
- Security team reviews security test coverage
- New features require corresponding security tests
- Security tests are part of threat modeling process

### Incident Response
- Security tests help validate fixes for security issues
- Tests can be updated to prevent regression of security bugs
- Attack patterns from incidents are added to test suite
